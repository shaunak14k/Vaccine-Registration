	<h2 style="background-color: lavender;">What is Meningitis (Meningococcal Meningitis)</h2>
<p>Meningococcal meningitis is a bacterial infection of the meninges and blood. The meninges are membranes that cover the brain and spinal cord. It is caused by different types of bacteria called Neisseria meningtidis. It is spread through airborne droplets or contact of objects contaminated by an infected person’s secretions. Close contact of a carrier increases the risk.</p>

<p>Adolescents and young adults are at an increased risk of contracting meningitis due to certain lifestyle factors and behaviors.</p>
<ul>
<li>People is close quarters such as schools</li>
<li>Living in close quarters such as dormitories</li>
<li>Sharing drinking glasses, eating utensils or water bottles</li>
<li>Kissing</li>
<li>Smoking</li>
</ul>
<p>Since the risk is higher in young adults and adolescents, meningitis vaccine is required in many states (including Nevada) for seventh-graders and freshmen in college. The initial vaccine for adolescents is recommended at 11 years old. Because the vaccine effectiveness wains over time, a booster vaccine is recommended at 16 years old.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of meningitis are rapidly progressing and commonly begin with fever, chills, tiredness and rash and hours to days later severe headache, neck and back pain, neck stiffness, vomiting, change of consciousness and coma. In some meningitis infections, the serious complications of shock, coma and death can occur within hours even with proper medical treatment.</p>

<p>About 10-15% of people with bacterial meningococcal infection die even with antibiotic treatment. Meningitis is diagnosed by testing blood and spinal fluid samples taken.  Unfortunately, because meningitis symptoms can sometimes be mistaken for other illnesses, it can lead to delayed diagnosis and treatment.</p>

<p>Serious complications of Meningitis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Neurologic complications</li>
<li>Brain Damage</li>
<li>Amputations</li>
<li>Shock</li>
<li>Deafness</li>
<li>Death in more than 70% of untreated infected persons</li>
</ul>

   <h2> About the Vaccine</h2>
   <p>The vaccine is administered into the deltoid muscle of the arm. It can be given into the muscle of the upper leg in infants.</p>

<p>The vaccine that is usually given is a Quadrivalent vaccine (MCV4 or MenACWY). It protects against serotypes A, C, W-135, and Y. This is also the vaccine that is recommended for travel to risk countries in Africa and to Saudi Arabia for the Hajj.</p>

<p>The number of doses that should be administered varies depending on the reason for vaccination, age, and health information.</p>

<p>Generally, travelers at risk should be revaccinated 3-5 years after the first dose if continued to be at risk.</p>

<p>Adolescents should be initially vaccinated routinely at age 11-12 with a booster at age 16. If the adolescent is vaccinated later between 13-15 the booster should be given 16-18 years up to age 21 years. If the first vaccine was given at 16 years or older a booster is not needed unless at a continued risk after 5 years.</p>

<p>College students who will live in dorm or residence halls should be given a dose if the last dose was given less than 16 years of age.</p>

<p>Laboratory workers who will work with Neisseria meningitides bacteria should be vaccinated every 5 years.</p>

<p>e7 Health also carries the Meningococcal B vaccine (MenB vaccine). This vaccine is recommended for the following</p>
<ul>
<li>People at risk because of a serogroup B meningococcal outbreak</li>
<li>Anyone whose spleen is damaged or has been removed</li>
<li>Anyone with complement component deficiency</li>
<li>Anyone taking a certain immunosupressant medications</li>
<li>Microbiologists who routinely work with isolates of N. meningitidis</li>
</ul>
<p>MenB vaccine is also given as an intramuscular injection into the deltoid muscle.</p>
