	<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Tetanus is a bacterial disease that is caused by a toxin produced by Clostridium tetani. The bacteria lives in the soil. It can be spread through a cuts, abrasions, punctures, burns or other breaks in the skin.</p>

<p>Diphtheria is also a bacterial disease that is caused by Corynebacterium diphtheria. This bacteria is spread person to person through oral or respiratory droplets and/or close contact with an infected person. Sometimes in countries where it has warmer climates there is transmission through discharge from skin lesions.</p>

<p>Pertussis is also known as "Whooping Cough." Pertussis is highly contagious and is caused by the bacteria Bordetella pertussis. It is also spread from person to person through methods like coughing, sneezing, or contact with the respiratory secretions.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Tetanus symptoms include stiff neck or jaw muscles, unable to relax your muscles which become tight and painful, difficulty breathing and swallowing, irritability, sweating, fast heartbeat, fever, and painful muscle spasms.</p>

<p>Serious complications of Tetanus include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Breathing problems</li>
<li>Seizure-like activity</li>
<li>Severe nervous system disorders	</li>
<li>Death</li>
</ul>

<p>Diphtheria symptoms include a sore throat, hoarseness, difficulty swallowing, fever, nasal drainage, and thick gray pseudo-membrane that attaches tightly to the tissue where it is formed. The membrane can extend into different parts of the respiratory tract and lead to respiratory problems, aspiration, suffocation, or death.</p>

<p>Pertussis infection is described in a series of phases that usually last about 3 months.</p>

<p>The first phase called the "Catarrhal phase" is described as general tiredness, runny nose, mild temperature and mild cough and lasts for 1-2 weeks.</p>

<p>The second phase is called the "Paroxysmal phase" is a severe series of coughs that occur during when a person breaths out and then when a person breaths in the hallmark "whooping" sound is made. The sound is more likely to be heard in young children and infants. Vomiting and loss of consciousness can occur during this phase. The coughing occurs constantly but may be worse at night and can last two to three months.</p>

<p>The third phase is described as an improvement of the cough severity and frequency and lasts for one to two weeks.</p>

<p>Serious complications of Pertussis include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Hemorrhage of the eye</li>
<li>Abdominal hernia</li>
<li>Fracture of ribs</li>
<li>Urinary incontinence</li>
<li>Back strain</li>
<li>Brain Hemorrhage</li>
<li>Stroke</li>
</ul>
<p>Infants and young children have the highest morbidity and mortality. The group who has a higher risk of infection that will have complications especially include newborns, adults, pregnant women, and people who have a compromised immune system.</p>

<h2>WHO SHOULD HAVE THE TDAP VACCINE?</h2>
<p>Tetanus and Pertussis occur anywhere in the world and Pertussis in particular remains a very poorly controlled but vaccine-preventable disease. There has been a resurgence as the vaccine wears off over time. Everyone eligible to have the vaccine should be vaccinated. This is a routine childhood vaccine called Dtap and booster shots should be given to adults every 10 years with TdaP. It is important for travelers to be up to date due to the increased risk for diphtheria in developing countries and risk for pertussis is worldwide.

If you have an injury that results in a bad wound, you should have a tetanus shot within 5 years.</p>
