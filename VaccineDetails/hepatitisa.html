	<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Hepatitis A is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. The hepatitis A virus (HAV) is spread through fecal-oral transmission meaning it can be spread by unhygienic food handling or poor water treatment. Although very rare, HAV can also be spread through blood transfusion.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Once a person is infected with HAV they may or may not have symptoms of the disease which includes fever, anorexia, nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and discomfort, diarrhea, dark urine and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Some people, especially young children, may show no outward signs of infection, but may still be able to spread the disease.</p>
<h2>Prevalence</h2>
<p>Nationwide epidemics of HAV occur in the United States approximately every 10 years. Rates of HAV infection in the United States has been steadily declining since 1995 which is attributed to high vaccination rates.</p>

<h2>Recommended for?</h2>
<p>Because the hepatitis A virus is easily spread by close personal contact with an infected person, or by ingesting contaminated foods or water, it is often recommended for travelers to third world and endemic countries and people in the food service industry. It may also be required by some school programs. For travelers, the first dose of HAV vaccine should be given as soon as a departure date is determined. Other groups at increased risk for HAV are men who have sex with men, and people who use illegal street drugs. HAV vaccine is also recommended for:</p>
