	<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Measles, mumps, and rubella (MMR) are serious viral infections that spread through the air which makes these diseases highly contagious. They are especially prevalent in areas where people are in close contact and experiences resurgences when vaccination rates drop. MMR vaccine protects you from all three diseases.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Symptoms of measles infection includes cough, high fever, rash on the body and inside the mouth, runny nose, anorexia, diarrhea, swollen lymph nodes, and eye irritation. Pneumonia and acute encephalitis caused by the measles infection is the most common cause of death in young children and adults. Symptoms of mumps include low-grade fever, headache, anorexia, muscle pain, swelling of the glands, and earache, although some cases can be asymptomatic. Mumps may also lead to more serious conditions such as meningitis and inflammation of the testicles or ovaries. Rubella, also known as Germain Measles, causes rash, low-grade fever, swelling of lymph glands, and arthritis. Pregnant women who contract rubella are at an increased risk for miscarriage and serious birth defects.</p>

<h2>Prevalence</h2>
<p>Before the vaccine was available, measles infected up to 90% of the population before age 15 and 500 deaths were reported annually from measles. Since the vaccines release in 1963, the incidence of measles has dropped by more than 98%. Measles has a resurgence in 1989-1991 due to lower vaccination coverage in school age children. Once vaccine coverage was increased, rates of measles infection again decreased. Another resurgence occurred in 2008, mostly among school age children who were unvaccinated. Mumps experienced a resurgence in 2006 and 2009, but was largely contained due to high vaccination rates in the affected communities. Rubella outbreaks occurred in California and Pennsylvania were reported in 1990-1991. Most cases of rubella are reported from women who live in areas where rubella vaccination is not routinely used.
