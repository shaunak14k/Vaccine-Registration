<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>After a person becomes infected, the period before symptoms appear is variable but is generally 20-90 days after exposure depending on the severity and site of the bite. Sometimes, the incubation period can last up to several years.

Initial symptoms can include:
<ul>
<li>Tingling at the site of the bite/scratch</li>
