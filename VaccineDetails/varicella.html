	<h2>What is Chickenpox</h2>
<p>Varicella (Chickenpox) is a virus called Varicella-zoster virus that is very contagious. It is spread through the air or with talking. It can also be spread by touching virus particles. If someone has not already been vaccinated or had Chickenpox, the virus can also be spread by people with Shingles. After having Chickenpox, the virus becomes dormant and can reactivate later in life causing Shingles.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>The very itchy red bumps or chickenpox are quite memorable to those who have had it and seen it. The disease starts with fever, sore throat, decreased appetite, and feeling sick. Then the virus causes approximately 200-500 itchy blisters that eventually blister and pop forming scabs generally over aa period of a few days on the face, chest, back, arms, and legs. An infected person is contagious starting 1-2 days before the rash begins.</p>

<p>Serious complications of Chickenpox include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Skin infection</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
<li>Encephalitis (an inflammation of the brain</li>
<li>Pneumonia</li>
</ul>
<p>The group who has a higher risk of infection that will have complications especially include newborns, adults, pregnant women, and people who have a compromised immune system.</p>

<h2>WHO SHOULD HAVE THE VARICELLA (CHICKENPOX) VACCINE?</h2>
<ul>

<p>Everyone eligible to have the vaccine should be vaccinated unless that person already has immunity from having Chickenpox infection and especially:</p>
<li>Susceptible travelers</li>	
<li>Health students and workers</li>
<li>Teachers</li>
<li>Military</li>
<li>People who live in nursing homes or residential settings</li>
<li>College students</li>
<li>People who work in correctional institutions</li>
<li>Child care workers</li>
<li>If you live with children</li>
<li>Non pregnant women of childbearing age</li>
<li>Immigrants and refugees</li>
</div>
</div></div>
   

  <h2>About the Vaccine</h2>
<p>The vaccine is administered in 2 doses separated by at least 28 days. It is given in the fatty tissue on the back of the arm.</p>

<p>The vaccine can protect if you have been exposed to someone with Chickenpox and is 70-100% effective in protecting against Chickenpox if given within 72 hours of exposure.</p>

<p>Communities with herd immunity extends protection to infants who are too young to be vaccinated and for adults who are unvaccinated due to certain contraindications.</p>

<p>The vaccine should be given starting in childhood at 12 months of age but adolescents and adults can have the vaccine as well later. The vaccine is very safe and effective and protects against almost all cases of severe disease. Not only does the vaccine protect yourself it also helps protect your community especially those that cannot get the vaccine such as weakened immune system and pregnant women. For those who still get chickenpox the infection is usually more mild with less blisters. The Varicella vaccine provides approximately 92-93% immunity with the two recommended doses.</p>

<p>To have evidence of immunity against Varicella you should have one of the following:</p>
  <ul>
  
  <li>2 doses of the Varicella vaccines separated by at least 28 days both given after 1 year of age or</li>
<li>a laboratory test called a titer that shows evidence of immunity or</li>
<li>Diagnosis of Chickenpox infection of Herpes Zoster infection by a health care provider (sometimes not accepted if you are a health care worker or student)</li>
