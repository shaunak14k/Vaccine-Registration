We offer same day or next day appointments and allow you to book your appointments online!</p>
	<h2>What is it?</h2>
<p>Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is spread through contaminated blood and other bodily fluids, but can also live on objects for up to seven days. In the United States, approximately 2,000 to 4,000 people die each year from complications of HBV such as cirrhosis and liver cancer. It is estimated that approximately 1.4 million people in the United States are infected with HBV.</p>

<h2>Symptoms</h2>
<p>Once a person is infected with HBV they may or may not have symptoms of the disease which includes anorexia, fever, rashes, nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and discomfort, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle and joint pain, dark urine, clay colored stools, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Some people, especially young children, may show no outward signs of infection, but may still be able to spread the disease. Young children are at an increased risk for becoming chronically infected with HBV and are also more likely to be asymptomatic, increasing their risk for spreading the disease.</p>

<h2>Prevalence</h2>
<p>Rates of HBV infection in the United States has been steadily declining since the 1980s which is attributed to high vaccination rates and HIV prevention efforts. The CDC reports that approximately 5,000-8,000 individuals become chronically infected with HBV each year.</p>

<h2>Recommended for?</h2>
<p>Since HBV can be easily spread through contact with blood and bodily fluids of infected individuals it is often recommended for health care workers and some travelers. HBV vaccine is also recommended for:</p>

Pregnant women who are identified as being at risk for HBV infection during pregnancy (e.g., having more than one sex partner during the previous 6 months, been evaluated or treated for an STD, recent or current injection drug use, or having had an HBsAg-positive sex partner) should be vaccinated but that would be best determined by a patient’s Primary OB/GYN provider.</p>
