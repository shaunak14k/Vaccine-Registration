        <h3>WHAT IS INFLUENZA VACCINE?</h3>
		<br>
    Influenza is a serious contagious virus that may lead to hospitalization and sometimes even death. 
		Influenza infection affects people differently. Even healthy people may become
		very sick from the flu virus and spread it to others.
		Flu season can begin as early as October and last until May in the United States. 
		The annual flu vaccine is the best way to reduce your chance of having the seasonal flu and decreases
		the chance that you will spread it to others. The more people that are vaccinated in the community, 
		the less the flu can spread.
		Travelers are at a particularly high risk for flu infection. 
		The Northern Hemisphere has a seasonal flu virus usually between October until May. 
		The Southern Hemisphere may begin in April and last through September. 
		The tropical and subtropical areas may have transmission present throughout the year. 
		Travelers are at a higher risk for infection due to air travel and cruise ships which 
		easily facilitate flu transmission.

        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Once a person is infected with HBV they may or may not have symptoms of the disease which includes anorexia,
          fever, rashes, nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and discomfort, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle and joint
          pain, dark urine, clay colored stools, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Some people, especially
          young children, may show no outward signs of infection, but may still be able to spread the disease. Young
          children are at an increased risk for becoming chronically infected with HBV and are also more likely to be
          asymptomatic, increasing their risk for spreading the disease.</p>

        <h3>What will this season's flu vaccine protect against?</h3>
        <p> The flu vaccine protects against 3 or 4 different strains of Influenza virus, depending on which type of flu vaccine you receive. There are different types of flu vaccines recommended for different age groups to optimize a person's level of protection. <br><br>

        <li>Used for people 6 months through 64 years of age</li>
        <li>This flu vaccine is thimerosal free and preservative free</li>
        <li>This flu vaccine is quadrivalent (protects against four strains).</li>
      
        <br><br>

        About 70-90% of flu deaths occur among people 65 and older. The high dose flu shot produces a stronger immune response, meaning the person with the vaccine is less likely to get sick.

        Getting a flu shot is more important than it may sound. It will help keep you healthy, but it will also protect others that may not be able to get the vaccine or are at a higher risk of getting sick. Vaccinedoor offers this season's flu shot, meaning you can stay healthy and keep others healthy as well.
