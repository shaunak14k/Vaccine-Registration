        <h3>What is it?</h3>
        <p>Hepatitis B is a disease of the liver caused by a virus. The hepatitis B virus (HBV) is spread through
          contaminated blood and other bodily fluids, but can also live on objects for up to seven days. In the United
          States, approximately 2,000 to 4,000 people die each year from complications of HBV such as cirrhosis and
          liver cancer. It is estimated that approximately 1.4 million people in the United States are infected with
          HBV.</p>

    <div id="parent2">

      <div id="content2">
        <h3>Symptoms</h3>
        <p>Once a person is infected with HBV they may or may not have symptoms of the disease which includes anorexia,
          fever, rashes, nausea, malaise, abdominal pain and discomfort, nausea, vomiting, headache, muscle and joint
          pain, dark urine, clay colored stools, and jaundice (yellowing of the skin and eyes). Some people, especially
          young children, may show no outward signs of infection, but may still be able to spread the disease. Young
          children are at an increased risk for becoming chronically infected with HBV and are also more likely to be
          asymptomatic, increasing their risk for spreading the disease.</p>

        <h3>Prevalence</h3>
        <p>Nationwide epidemics of HAV occur in the United States approximately every 10 years. Rates of HAV infection
          in the United States has been steadily declining since 1995 which is attributed to high vaccination rates.

    <h1>Recommended for?</h1>
    <br><br>
    <p style="text-align: center; font-size: 16px;">
      Because the hepatitis A virus is easily spread by close personal contact with an infected person, or by ingesting
      contaminated foods or water, it is often<br> recommended for travelers to third world and endemic countries and
      people in the food service industry. <br>It may also be required by some school programs. For travelers, the first
      dose of HAV vaccine should be given<br> as soon as a departure date is determined. Other groups at increased risk
      for HAV<br> are men who have sex with men, and people who use illegal street drugs. <br>HAV vaccine is also
      recommended for:
